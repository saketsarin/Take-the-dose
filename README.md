# Take-the-dose
We're humans and it's well known that we can sometimes have a weak memory right? So we thought why not make a medicine and exercise reminder app for the community!

# What it does
This is a web-based application in which a medicine reminder system is implemented.it focuses on the doctor and patient interaction.in general, most patients forget to take medication at the required time. It affects the dosage required for the patients that result in not yielding the recovery results. Our application is useful because we can set a time for multiple medicines and add medicine. At that time notification will be sent to them through a message inside the system preferably chosen by the patients, another feature is that you can take exercise tips .we have made an attempt to develop a system that is economical, time-saving and supports medication adherence.

# How we built it
With basic HTML, CSS for the front-end and Node.js for the backend! Also, we used figma for prototyping.

# Challenges we ran into
Integrating the front-end with the backend

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
Completing this project in such a short duration! sigh

# What we learned
Alot about node.js and databases because we're new to it

# What's next for Take the Dose
Adding a panel for doctors to add the medicines themselves to the patients dashboard and expanding the exercise tab!
